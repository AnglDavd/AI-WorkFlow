## 🚀 Act 3: Supervised Implementation - Task by Task

### Task 1.1: Development Environment Setup

**🤖 AI Proposal:**
```bash
./ai-dev dev --propose abc123 1.1
```

**🤖 AI:** *"I propose setting up PHP 8 environment with simple MVC structure:*
```
flores-valle/
├── public/
│   ├── index.php
│   ├── css/
│   └── js/
├── src/
│   ├── controllers/
│   ├── models/
│   └── views/
├── config/
└── database/
```
*Also installing composer for autoloading and SQLite for database."*

**Implementation preview:**
```bash
./ai-dev collaborate --preview abc123 1.1
```

**🤖 AI shows detailed preview:**
```
📁 Files to create/modify:
   - composer.json (PHP dependencies)
   - public/index.php (front controller)
   - config/database.php (DB configuration)
   - .htaccess (URL rewriting)

🔧 Key implementation points:
   - PSR-4 autoloading structure
   - Environment configuration
   - Database connection setup
   - Error handling configuration
```

**Developer approval with modifications:**
```bash
./ai-dev dev --approve abc123 1.1 --changes "Add local development configuration with detailed setup instructions"
```

**🤖 AI:** *"Understood. Implementing with local development configuration included..."*

### Task 2.1: Product Catalog System

**🤖 AI Proposal:**
```bash
./ai-dev dev --propose abc123 2.1
```

**🤖 AI:** *"For the flower catalog, I propose:*
- *Product model with categories (roses, tulips, arrangements)*
- *Simple inventory system*
- *Responsive image gallery*
- *Category and price filters"*

**Client intervention - Real-world requirements:**

**👨‍💻 Developer Alex:** *"Wait, Maria, what specific categories do you handle?"*

**👤 Client Maria:** *"I have individual flowers, pre-made bouquets, potted plants, and event arrangements. I also need to mark which ones are available by season."*

**Requirement adjustment:**
```bash
./ai-dev dev --approve abc123 2.1 --changes "Add 4 specific categories: individual flowers, bouquets, potted plants, event arrangements. Include seasonal availability system."
```

**🤖 AI:** *"Perfect. Adjusting model to include the 4 specific categories and seasonal availability field..."*

### Unexpected Problem: Task 2.3 - Inventory System

**🤖 AI Proposal:**
```bash
./ai-dev dev --propose abc123 2.3
```

**🤖 AI:** *"I propose automatic inventory system that decrements stock when orders are confirmed..."*

**Real-world business logic discovery:**

**👨‍💻 Developer Alex:** *"Maria, how do you currently handle your inventory? Do you buy flowers based on orders or maintain stock?"*

**👤 Client Maria:** *"Actually, I buy flowers based on orders. Only potted plants I keep in fixed stock."*

**👨‍💻 Developer Alex:** *"Ah, this changes the approach. Claude, we need a hybrid system."*

**Business logic adaptation:**
```bash
./ai-dev dev --approve abc123 2.3 --changes "Hybrid inventory: on-demand for fresh flowers (24-48h prep time), fixed inventory for potted plants only"
```

---

## 🔄 Act 4: Context Management & Session Persistence

### Interruption Handling - Real Scenario

**⏰ Emergency interruption: Developer must leave**

**👨‍💻 Developer Alex:** *"Maria, I have to handle an emergency. Claude, save all project context."*

```bash
./ai-dev context --save abc123
```

**🤖 AI:** *"Context saved completely. Includes technology decisions, task approvals, and specific changes requested."*

**--- 2 days later ---**

**👨‍💻 Developer Alex returns:** *"Claude, let's restore Maria's project context."*

```bash
./ai-dev context --restore abc123
```

**🤖 AI restores context:**
```
📋 Project: flores-valle
🔧 Complexity: Simple
💻 Technology: option-1 (PHP stack)
📊 Progress: 3/18 tasks completed
✅ Approved: 3 tasks approved

📝 Recent Decisions:
  - technology: option-1 (2025-07-19T16:34:09)
  - task_approval: 1.1 (local dev config added)
  - task_approval: 2.1 (4 categories + seasonal)
  - task_approval: 2.3 (hybrid inventory system)
```

**👨‍💻 Developer Alex:** *"Perfect, exactly where we left off. Let's continue."*

---

## 💳 Act 5: Payment Integration - Real Complexity

### Task 3.1: Payment System

**🤖 AI Proposal:**
```bash
./ai-dev dev --propose abc123 3.1
```

**🤖 AI:** *"For payments, I propose Stripe integration for cards and PayPal for alternatives..."*

**Geographic and business considerations:**

**👤 Client Maria:** *"Do I need special accounts for that? Are there fees?"*

**👨‍💻 Developer Alex:** *"Good question. Claude, analyze payment options specific to Mexico and small businesses."*

**🤖 AI:** *"Analyzing options for Mexico:*
- *Stripe: 3.6% + $3 MXN per transaction*
- *PayPal: 4.4% + $4 MXN*
- *Mercado Pago: 4.0% + $2 MXN (better for Mexico)*
- *Also suggest cash on delivery for local orders"*

**Regional adaptation:**
```bash
./ai-dev dev --approve abc123 3.1 --changes "Use Mercado Pago instead of Stripe, add cash on delivery option for local orders"
```

**🤖 AI detects potential issue:**

**🤖 AI:** *"Warning: Mercado Pago requires HTTPS validation and webhook setup. Does hosting support SSL certificates?"*

**👨‍💻 Developer Alex:** *"Good observation. Maria, do you have hosting or do we need to include it?"*

**👤 Client Maria:** *"I don't have anything yet."*

**Infrastructure planning:**
**👨‍💻 Developer Alex:** *"Claude, update the plan to include hosting with SSL."*

---

## 📱 Act 6: Unexpected Client Requirement

### Mid-Project Scope Addition

**👤 Client Maria:** *"I forgot to mention, many of my customers are seniors and aren't very tech-savvy. Can we make it very easy to use?"*

**Impact analysis:**

**👨‍💻 Developer Alex:** *"Claude, analyze the impact of adding accessibility improvements and simplified UX."*

```bash
./ai-dev context --validate-deps abc123
```

**🤖 AI detects impact:**
```
⚠️ New requirement may affect:
- Task 4.2: Frontend UI (needs senior-friendly design)
- Task 4.3: Mobile responsiveness (larger buttons/text)
- Task 5.1: User testing (include senior user testing)
- Estimated additional time: 8-12 hours
- Budget impact: +$400-600
```

**Change management:**

**👨‍💻 Developer Alex:** *"Maria, this would add about 10 hours of work, around $500 additional. Is that okay?"*

**👤 Client Maria:** *"Yes, it's worth it. My customers are very important."*

**Scope update:**
```bash
# AI automatically updates context with new requirement
echo "Senior-friendly UX requirements added" >> .ai_context_abc123.json
```

---

## 🧪 Act 7: Collaborative Testing

### Task 4.4: User Testing

**🤖 AI Proposal:**
```bash
./ai-dev dev --propose abc123 4.4
```

**🤖 AI:** *"I propose automated testing with PHPUnit plus manual testing with UX checklist..."*

**Real user integration:**

**👨‍💻 Developer Alex:** *"Maria, could you get 2-3 regular customers to test the system?"*

**👤 Client Maria:** *"Of course! I have customers who would be happy to help."*

**Testing approach refinement:**
```bash
./ai-dev dev --approve abc123 4.4 --changes "Add real user testing sessions with 3 senior customers, document feedback and iterate"
```

**🤖 AI:** *"Excellent approach. Adding real user testing sessions and feedback iteration process."*

---

## 🚨 Act 8: Critical Error Handling

### Security Vulnerability Detection

**⚠️ During payment implementation, unexpected error:**

**👨‍💻 Developer Alex attempts test:**
```bash
./ai-dev collaborate --review abc123 payment.php
```

**🤖 AI detects problem:**
```
❌ Security issue detected: API keys visible in code
❌ Missing input validation for payment amounts
❌ No error handling for failed transactions
```

**Enhanced error handler activation:**
```
🚨 Enhanced Error Handler: security_vulnerability
📍 Context: Payment processing implementation
🔧 Session: abc123

⚠️ CRITICAL: Security vulnerabilities detected
🔍 Issues found:
- API keys exposed in code
- Missing payment validation
- No transaction error handling

💡 Immediate actions required:
1. Move API keys to environment variables
2. Add amount validation (min/max limits)
3. Implement transaction error handling
4. Add payment logging for audit trail
```

**Immediate security remediation:**

**👨‍💻 Developer Alex:** *"Claude, implement all these security fixes immediately."*

**🤖 AI:** *"Implementing critical security corrections. This is priority for a payment system..."*
