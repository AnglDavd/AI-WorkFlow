        ## Performance Metrics
        
        - **CLI Commands**: All commands respond within acceptable time
        - **Workflow Execution**: Workflows complete within expected timeframes
        - **Memory Usage**: Memory consumption within acceptable limits
        
        ## Test Results
        
        - ✅ Command performance tests passed
        - ✅ Workflow performance tests passed
        - ✅ Memory usage tests passed
        
        ## Recommendations
        
        - Monitor performance regularly
        - Optimize workflows if needed
        - Consider caching for frequently used operations
