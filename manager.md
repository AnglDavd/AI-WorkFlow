# ðŸš€ Dynamic Project Manager (DPM)

Welcome to the project management system based on the Dynamic Project Manifest. All logic and workflows are driven by `.md` files for maximum transparency and auditability.

**This file is the main entry point.**

## Key Principles

- **Transparency:** What you see is what is executed. No hidden logic.
- **User Control:** The system proposes, the user approves.
- **Self-Improvement:** The system learns from feedback and errors to evolve.
