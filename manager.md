## ðŸš€ Quick Start: The `ai-dev` CLI

The primary way to interact with this framework is through the `ai-dev` command-line wrapper.

**To see all available commands, run:**
```bash
./ai-dev help
```

### Core Commands (15 Total Commands)

-   **`./ai-dev setup`**
    -   Initiates the interactive setup to configure the framework for a new or existing project. **This is the first command you should run.**

-   **`./ai-dev generate <path_to_prd.md>`**
    -   Takes a Product Requirements Document (PRD) and generates one or more executable Project-Response-Plan (PRP) files.

-   **`./ai-dev run <path_to_prp.md>`**
    -   Executes a specific PRP using the AI agent engine, which will then write code, run tests, and attempt to complete the task.

-   **`./ai-dev optimize <prompt_file>`**
    -   Optimizes prompt files using best practices and token economy analysis.

-   **`./ai-dev performance <subcommand>`**
    -   Performance optimization and monitoring for the framework.

### Quality & Security Commands

-   **`./ai-dev quality <path>`**
    -   Runs comprehensive quality validation with adaptive language support (30+ languages). Works automatically in the background.

-   **`./ai-dev audit`**
    -   Performs security audit and compliance checking across the entire framework.

-   **`./ai-dev precommit <subcommand>`**
    -   Manages pre-commit validation system. Subcommands: `validate`, `install-hooks`, `configure`, `report`.

### Framework Management Commands

-   **`./ai-dev sync <subcommand>`**
    -   Synchronizes framework with updates and community improvements.
    -   **`./ai-dev sync feedback`** - Integrate external community feedback from GitHub issues/PRs
    -   **`./ai-dev sync framework`** - Synchronize framework updates

-   **`./ai-dev configure [options]`**
    -   Interactive configuration management for framework settings.

-   **`./ai-dev diagnose`**
    -   Comprehensive health check and diagnostic reporting for the framework.

### Documentation & Maintenance Commands

-   **`./ai-dev generate-architecture`**
    -   Generate project architecture documentation.

-   **`./ai-dev update-architecture`**
    -   Update existing architecture documentation.

-   **`./ai-dev cleanup [options]`**
    -   Manage obsolete files and repository cleanup.

-   **`./ai-dev maintenance [level]`**
    -   Run periodic repository maintenance.

-   **`./ai-dev platform`**
    -   Show platform compatibility information.

### Utility Commands

-   **`./ai-dev help`**
    -   Show all available commands.

-   **`./ai-dev version`**
    -   Framework version and platform information.

-   **`./ai-dev status`**
    -   Current framework status.

-   **`./ai-dev verify-installation`**
    -   Verify framework installation integrity and auto-fix common issues.

## For AI Agents: How to Interpret User Requests

**Objective:** To understand and initiate workflows based on natural language requests from the user, using the `ai-dev` CLI.

**ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT:** Before proceeding with any actions, AI agents MUST first consult and follow the rules in `.ai_workflow/GLOBAL_AI_RULES.md`. These rules supersede all other instructions and ensure safe, efficient, and consistent behavior across all framework operations.

**Instructions for AI Agent:**

-   **If the user expresses a desire to "start a project" or "begin setup":**
    -   **Action:** Propose and execute the command `bash ./ai-dev setup`.
    -   **Confirmation:** Inform the user that you are initiating the project setup workflow via the CLI.

-   **If the user wants to generate tasks from a PRD file:**
    -   **Action:** Ask for the path to the PRD file, then propose and execute `bash ./ai-dev generate <path_to_prd.md>`.

-   **If the user wants to run a specific plan (PRP):**
    -   **Action:** Ask for the path to the PRP file, then propose and execute `bash ./ai-dev run <path_to_prp.md>`.

-   **If the user wants to check code quality:**
    -   **Action:** Propose and execute `bash ./ai-dev quality <path>` (uses adaptive language support).

-   **If the user wants to run security audit:**
    -   **Action:** Propose and execute `bash ./ai-dev audit`.

-   **If the user wants to integrate community feedback:**
    -   **Action:** Propose and execute `bash ./ai-dev sync feedback`.

-   **If the user wants to synchronize framework updates:**
    -   **Action:** Propose and execute `bash ./ai-dev sync framework`.

-   **If the user wants to configure the framework:**
    -   **Action:** Propose and execute `bash ./ai-dev configure`.

-   **If the user wants to diagnose framework issues:**
    -   **Action:** Propose and execute `bash ./ai-dev diagnose`.

-   **If the user asks a general question:**
    -   **Action:** Execute the workflow at `/.ai_workflow/workflows/assistant/01_ask_assistant.md`. (This is a temporary exception until it is integrated into the CLI).

## Automatic Features (Zero-Friction)

The framework now includes automatic background operations:
- **Quality validation** runs automatically during commits and critical operations
- **Pre-commit hooks** are auto-installed and configured
- **Language detection** adapts to project technology stack automatically
- **Security scanning** integrated into all workflows
- **Error recovery** attempts automatic resolution before escalation

## Interactive Dashboard

The framework includes a comprehensive web dashboard for real-time monitoring:
- **Location:** `.ai_workflow/docs/interactive/dashboard.html`
- **Features:** Real-time metrics, task management, system health monitoring
- **Data:** Live framework status, performance indicators, development progress
- **Usage:** Open the HTML file in any web browser for visual framework oversight

## Emergency Recovery & Updates

**Emergency Recovery:**
- **Script:** `.ai_workflow/scripts/emergency_recovery.sh`
- **Purpose:** Comprehensive framework recovery with auto-fix capabilities
- **Use when:** Framework issues, missing files, or critical failures occur

**Framework Updates:**
- **Script:** `.ai_workflow/scripts/framework_updater.sh`
- **Purpose:** Safe framework updates with automatic backup and rollback
- **Features:** Compatibility checks, backup creation, rollback on failure

## Production Validation
