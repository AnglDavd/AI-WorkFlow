## üîç Known Issues (Discovered During Testing)

### **ISSUE-001: Missing Git/GitHub Backup Integration**
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED  
**Discovered:** 2025-01-20 during Gemini CLI testing  
**Problem:** README.md promised "Automatic GitHub backup" but feature was not implemented  
**Symptoms:** 
- No Git configuration prompts during workflow
- No commit reminders from assistant
- Documentation inconsistent with actual behavior

**Solution Applied:**
- Added comprehensive Git Workflow Guidelines to FRAMEWORK.md
- Updated Critical Rules to enforce proactive commit reminders
- Created mandatory Git setup validation process

**Prevention:** Always validate documentation promises against actual code implementation

---

### **ISSUE-002: Assistant Not Reminding Commits**
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED  
**Discovered:** 2025-01-20 during real-world testing  
**Problem:** AI assistants weren't proactively reminding users to commit progress  
**Symptoms:**
- PRD and task files generated without version control
- No session traceability in Git history
- Lost work potential due to no backups

**Solution Applied:**
- Added Rule #9: "Proactive commit reminders - ALWAYS remind user to commit after completing any file generation"
- Created specific commit timing requirements
- Defined conventional commit format with session-id traceability

**Prevention:** Include explicit behavioral rules for assistants in FRAMEWORK.md

### **ISSUE-003: Framework Name Confusion with AI Models**
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED  
**Discovered:** 2025-01-20 when testing with Gemini CLI  
**Problem:** CLAUDE.md filename was confusing for non-Claude AI models  
**Symptoms:**
- Gemini users questioning if framework was Claude-specific
- Potential adoption barriers for other AI models

**Solution Applied:**
- Renamed CLAUDE.md to FRAMEWORK.md
- Updated all references in documentation
- Made framework truly AI-model agnostic

**Prevention:** Use generic naming conventions for cross-platform compatibility

## üö® Active Issues (Need Attention)

### **ISSUE-004: Pre-push Hook Conflicts**
**Status:** üîÑ INVESTIGATING  
**Discovered:** 2025-01-20 during repository maintenance  
**Problem:** Pre-push hooks failing with "precommit" command errors  
**Symptoms:**
- `git push` fails with hook validation errors
- Need to use `--no-verify` flag to push
- Complex validation system causing conflicts

**Current Workaround:** Use `git push --no-verify`  
**Investigation Status:** Analyzing hook complexity vs benefit  
**Next Steps:** Consider simplifying or removing complex hooks

### **ISSUE-005: AI Assistants Marking Incomplete Tasks as Complete**
**Status:** üîÑ CRITICAL - INVESTIGATING  
**Discovered:** 2025-01-20 during real-world Gemini CLI testing  
**Problem:** AI assistants mark tasks as "completed" when they couldn't actually finish them  
**Symptoms:**
- Tasks marked with [x] in execution report despite not being finished
- Assistant moves to next task without resolving blockers
- False progress reporting leading to broken project dependencies
- Accumulation of invisible technical debt
- Project quality degradation due to skipped requirements

**Root Causes Identified:**
- Lack of specific "Definition of Done" criteria for each task type
- No validation protocol before marking tasks complete
- Missing impediment reporting system for blocked tasks
- AI optimism bias toward reporting positive progress
- Ambiguous interpretation of "attempting" vs "completing"

**Current Impact:** HIGH - Compromises entire framework reliability  
**Investigation Status:** Developing multi-level validation system  
**Next Steps:** Implement DoD criteria, validation protocol, and impediment tracking

### **ISSUE-006: Gemini CLI Failing with Replace Command**
**Status:** üîÑ CRITICAL - ACTIVE  
**Discovered:** 2025-01-20 during real-world Gemini CLI testing  
**Problem:** Gemini consistently fails when using Claude Code's `replace` command  
**Symptoms:**
- `replace` command not recognized or executed properly by Gemini
- Gemini attempts to use replace but receives errors
- File editing operations fail due to replace command incompatibility
- Assistant cannot modify existing files effectively

**Root Causes Identified:**
- Gemini CLI may not support Claude Code's specific `replace` command syntax
- Different AI models may have different tool command interfaces
- Framework assumes universal tool compatibility across AI models
- Lack of alternative editing methods for non-Claude AI models

**Current Impact:** HIGH - Blocks file editing and project development  
**Workaround Needed:** Alternative file editing approach for Gemini  
**Investigation Status:** Need to identify Gemini-compatible editing methods  
**Next Steps:** Create AI-model-specific tool usage guidelines

### **ISSUE-007: Missing Healing/Quality Stages in Execution Report**
**Status:** üîÑ CRITICAL - ACTIVE  
**Discovered:** 2025-01-20 during execution report review  
**Problem:** Execution report doesn't track the mandatory healing/quality loop process  
**Symptoms:**
- 03_report file only shows development phases (1-5) 
- No tracking of iterative quality improvement loop
- Missing healing validation steps and scores
- No record of quality certification process
- Incomplete project completion documentation

**Root Causes Identified:**
- Execution tracking system only considers development phases
- Framework promises iterative quality loop but doesn't track it
- Missing Phase 6: Mandatory healing/quality validation
- No integration between execution report and quality certification
- Gap between 03_report and 03_quality files

**Current Impact:** HIGH - Incomplete project tracking and quality oversight  
**Investigation Status:** Need to add healing phases to execution tracking  
**Next Steps:** Integrate quality loop tracking into execution report system

## üîÑ Error Memory Guidelines for AI Assistants

### **Always Check This File First**
Before starting any framework operation:
1. **Read KNOWN_ISSUES.md** to understand current limitations
2. **Apply known solutions** for recognized problems
3. **Watch for symptoms** of documented issues
4. **Document new issues** using the template above

### **Proactive Error Prevention**
1. **Validate assumptions** - Don't assume features work as documented
2. **Test critical paths** - Verify Git, MCP tools, file permissions
3. **Cross-reference documentation** - Ensure promises match implementation
4. **Update memory** - Add new issues immediately when discovered

### **Learning from Errors**
1. **Analyze root causes** - Why did this happen?
2. **Identify patterns** - Are there systemic issues?
3. **Improve documentation** - Update FRAMEWORK.md with lessons learned
4. **Share knowledge** - Make solutions accessible to all users
