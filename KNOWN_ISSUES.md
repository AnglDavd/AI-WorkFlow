# Known Issues & Error Memory System

**Framework Version:** v3.1.1 Enhanced  
**Last Updated:** 2025-01-20  
**Purpose:** Track bugs, errors, and lessons learned to prevent recurring issues

---

## üéØ Error Memory System Overview

This file serves as the framework's memory system to:
- **Document bugs** encountered during real-world usage
- **Track solutions** and workarounds that worked
- **Prevent recurring** issues in future projects
- **Improve framework** reliability over time
- **Share knowledge** across all AI assistants using the framework

## üîç Known Issues (Discovered During Testing)

### **ISSUE-001: Missing Git/GitHub Backup Integration**
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED  
**Discovered:** 2025-01-20 during Gemini CLI testing  
**Problem:** README.md promised "Automatic GitHub backup" but feature was not implemented  
**Symptoms:** 
- No Git configuration prompts during workflow
- No commit reminders from assistant
- Documentation inconsistent with actual behavior

**Solution Applied:**
- Added comprehensive Git Workflow Guidelines to FRAMEWORK.md
- Updated Critical Rules to enforce proactive commit reminders
- Created mandatory Git setup validation process

**Prevention:** Always validate documentation promises against actual code implementation

### **ISSUE-002: Assistant Not Reminding Commits**
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED  
**Discovered:** 2025-01-20 during real-world testing  
**Problem:** AI assistants weren't proactively reminding users to commit progress  
**Symptoms:**
- PRD and task files generated without version control
- No session traceability in Git history
- Lost work potential due to no backups

**Solution Applied:**
- Added Rule #9: "Proactive commit reminders - ALWAYS remind user to commit after completing any file generation"
- Created specific commit timing requirements
- Defined conventional commit format with session-id traceability

**Prevention:** Include explicit behavioral rules for assistants in FRAMEWORK.md

### **ISSUE-003: Framework Name Confusion with AI Models**
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED  
**Discovered:** 2025-01-20 when testing with Gemini CLI  
**Problem:** CLAUDE.md filename was confusing for non-Claude AI models  
**Symptoms:**
- Gemini users questioning if framework was Claude-specific
- Potential adoption barriers for other AI models

**Solution Applied:**
- Renamed CLAUDE.md to FRAMEWORK.md
- Updated all references in documentation
- Made framework truly AI-model agnostic

**Prevention:** Use generic naming conventions for cross-platform compatibility

## üö® Active Issues (Need Attention)

### **ISSUE-004: Pre-push Hook Conflicts**
**Status:** üîÑ INVESTIGATING  
**Discovered:** 2025-01-20 during repository maintenance  
**Problem:** Pre-push hooks failing with "precommit" command errors  
**Symptoms:**
- `git push` fails with hook validation errors
- Need to use `--no-verify` flag to push
- Complex validation system causing conflicts

**Current Workaround:** Use `git push --no-verify`  
**Investigation Status:** Analyzing hook complexity vs benefit  
**Next Steps:** Consider simplifying or removing complex hooks

## üîÑ Error Memory Guidelines for AI Assistants

### **Always Check This File First**
Before starting any framework operation:
1. **Read KNOWN_ISSUES.md** to understand current limitations
2. **Apply known solutions** for recognized problems
3. **Watch for symptoms** of documented issues
4. **Document new issues** using the template above

### **Proactive Error Prevention**
1. **Validate assumptions** - Don't assume features work as documented
2. **Test critical paths** - Verify Git, MCP tools, file permissions
3. **Cross-reference documentation** - Ensure promises match implementation
4. **Update memory** - Add new issues immediately when discovered

### **Learning from Errors**
1. **Analyze root causes** - Why did this happen?
2. **Identify patterns** - Are there systemic issues?
3. **Improve documentation** - Update FRAMEWORK.md with lessons learned
4. **Share knowledge** - Make solutions accessible to all users
