# 🚀 AI-Assisted Development Framework 🚀

Welcome to the AI-Assisted Development Framework! This project provides a structured approach to building software with the help of advanced AI agents. It's designed to streamline your development workflow from ideation to code implementation and continuous improvement.

## ✨ Key Features

-   **Unified Workflow:** A single `manager.sh` script to orchestrate all AI-assisted development tasks.
-   **Model-Agnostic Prompts:** Prompts designed to work effectively with various AI models (e.g., Gemini, Claude, OpenAI).
-   **Structured PRD & PRP Creation:** Tools to generate detailed Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) and Product Requirement Prompts (PRPs).
-   **Automated Task Execution:** AI agents can execute granular tasks, write code, and perform validations.
-   **Continuous Quality:** Integrated commands for code review, refactoring, and Git operations.
-   **Clear Guidance:** Comprehensive documentation (`.ai_workflow/FRAMEWORK_GUIDE.md`) to guide you through every step.

## 🛠️ Available Commands

The `manager.sh` script is your primary interface with the framework. Use these commands to orchestrate your AI-assisted development workflows:

| Command             | Description                                                                 |
| :------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `setup`             | 🚀 Interactively sets up a new project from the framework.                  |
| `new-prd`           | 💡 Guides you to create a new Product Requirements Document (PRD).          |
| `new-prp`           | 📝 Creates a new Product Requirement Prompt (PRP) from a description.       |
| `run`               | ⚙️ Executes a PRP using a specified AI agent.                               |
| `assistant`         | 🧠 Interacts with the Framework Assistant to get guidance.                  |
| `help`              | ❓ Shows the help message with available commands.                          |

For detailed usage of each command and a deeper dive into the framework's workflows, refer to the `FRAMEWORK_GUIDE.md`.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To set up a new project using this framework, run the setup command:

```bash
./manager.sh setup
```

This command will guide you through creating a new project directory, moving the framework files, and initializing a new Git repository.
