## üí° The Challenge of Modern Development

In the fast-paced world of software development, teams constantly face challenges: repetitive tasks, code inconsistencies, high operational costs of AI tools, and the need to maintain control over complex processes. AI agent autonomy, while powerful, can raise concerns about project security and stability.

## ‚ú® Our Solution: The AI-Assisted Development Framework

This framework is an innovative system designed to empower development teams with artificial intelligence, ensuring transparency, control, and efficiency. We transform the way you build software, allowing AI agents to work autonomously, yet always under your supervision and with a focus on continuous optimization.

## üåü Key Features

*   **Dynamic Project Manager (DPM):** The core of the framework. A transparent, auditable, and self-improving system based on **`.md` workflow nodes**. All project logic is visible and editable, replacing monolithic scripts with human-readable, agent-executable manifests.
*   **Self-Extending Tools:** Need a new CLI tool? The framework can **dynamically create adapters** for undefined tools, guiding you through the integration process.
*   **Automated Token Economy Optimization:** A proactive system that **monitors and optimizes the token consumption** of your LLMs, helping you reduce costs and improve efficiency without compromising quality.
*   **Zero-Friction Pre-commit Validation System:** Revolutionary background quality assurance:
    *   **Seamless Auto-Installation:** Pre-commit hooks install automatically on first framework use
    *   **Intelligent Quality Gates:** Automated code quality, security, and compliance validation
    *   **Background Operation:** Works transparently without user intervention
    *   **Smart Reporting:** Detailed validation reports with actionable recommendations
    *   **Configurable Rules:** Customizable validation thresholds and quality standards
*   **Enterprise-Grade Security System:** Comprehensive security framework with multiple protection layers:
    *   **Input Validation:** Advanced sanitization preventing malicious commands and path traversal attacks
    *   **Permission Management:** Automated verification of file system access rights
    *   **Secure Execution:** Sandboxed command execution with resource limits and timeout controls
    *   **Security Auditing:** Continuous vulnerability scanning and compliance monitoring
    *   **Critical File Change Approval:** Agent requests explicit confirmation before modifying key project files
    *   **Mandatory Testing:** Automated execution of tests before and after each code change
    *   **Rapid Rollback:** Ability to easily undo the last commit
*   **Model-Agnostic Prompts:** Designed to work effectively with various AI models (e.g., Gemini, Claude, OpenAI), ensuring flexibility.
*   **Intuitive Natural Language Interaction:** Initiate complex `workflows` with simple, conversational requests to your agent.
*   **Community Integration & Synchronization:** Advanced collaboration features for shared improvement:
    *   **External Feedback Integration:** Automated processing of community contributions and improvements
    *   **Framework Synchronization:** Safe integration of upstream updates with conflict resolution
    *   **Version Management:** Intelligent tracking of framework versions and compatibility verification
    *   **Privacy-Safe Sharing:** Share framework optimizations without exposing project-specific data
*   **Continuous Learning and Improvement:** The framework learns from each interaction, optimizing its processes and adapting to your needs.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Getting started is simple and clean! The framework installs as a hidden subdirectory in your project:

### Quick Installation

```bash
# 1. Create your project directory
mkdir my-awesome-project
cd my-awesome-project

# 2. Clone the framework as a hidden subdirectory
git clone https://github.com/AnglDavd/AI-WorkFlow.git .ai_framework

# 3. Start using the framework
./.ai_framework/ai-dev setup
```

### Natural Language Integration

Once installed, simply instruct your AI assistant:

```
let's start the project using the AI framework @.ai_framework/manager.md
```

Your AI agent will interpret this request, access the hidden framework, and guide you through the setup process.

### Available Commands

The framework provides these powerful commands from your project root:

```bash
# Core Commands
./.ai_framework/ai-dev setup                    # Initialize project setup
./.ai_framework/ai-dev generate <prd_file>      # Generate tasks from PRD
./.ai_framework/ai-dev run <prp_file>           # Execute Project Response Plans
./.ai_framework/ai-dev optimize <prompt_file>   # Optimize prompts and reduce costs

# Enhanced Commands (v0.4.2-beta)
