# üöÄ AI-Assisted Development Framework | Your Autonomous Software Engineering Partner

## üí° The Challenge of Modern Development

In the fast-paced world of software development, teams constantly face challenges: repetitive tasks, code inconsistencies, high operational costs of AI tools, and the need to maintain control over complex processes. AI agent autonomy, while powerful, can raise concerns about project security and stability.

## ‚ú® Our Solution: The AI-Assisted Development Framework

This framework is an innovative system designed to empower development teams with artificial intelligence, ensuring transparency, control, and efficiency. We transform the way you build software, allowing AI agents to work autonomously, yet always under your supervision and with a focus on continuous optimization.

## üåü Key Features

*   **Dynamic Project Manager (DPM):** The core of the framework. A transparent, auditable, and self-improving system based on **`.md` workflow nodes**. All project logic is visible and editable, replacing monolithic scripts with human-readable, agent-executable manifests.
*   **Self-Extending Tools:** Need a new CLI tool? The framework can **dynamically create adapters** for undefined tools, guiding you through the integration process.
*   **Automated Token Economy Optimization:** A proactive system that **monitors and optimizes the token consumption** of your LLMs, helping you reduce costs and improve efficiency without compromising quality.
*   **Enterprise-Grade Security System:** Comprehensive security framework with multiple protection layers:
    *   **Input Validation:** Advanced sanitization preventing malicious commands and path traversal attacks
    *   **Permission Management:** Automated verification of file system access rights
    *   **Secure Execution:** Sandboxed command execution with resource limits and timeout controls
    *   **Security Auditing:** Continuous vulnerability scanning and compliance monitoring
    *   **Critical File Change Approval:** Agent requests explicit confirmation before modifying key project files
    *   **Mandatory Testing:** Automated execution of tests before and after each code change
    *   **Rapid Rollback:** Ability to easily undo the last commit
*   **Model-Agnostic Prompts:** Designed to work effectively with various AI models (e.g., Gemini, Claude, OpenAI), ensuring flexibility.
*   **Intuitive Natural Language Interaction:** Initiate complex `workflows` with simple, conversational requests to your agent.
*   **Community Integration & Synchronization:** Advanced collaboration features for shared improvement:
    *   **External Feedback Integration:** Automated processing of community contributions and improvements
    *   **Framework Synchronization:** Safe integration of upstream updates with conflict resolution
    *   **Version Management:** Intelligent tracking of framework versions and compatibility verification
    *   **Privacy-Safe Sharing:** Share framework optimizations without exposing project-specific data
*   **Continuous Learning and Improvement:** The framework learns from each interaction, optimizing its processes and adapting to your needs.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Getting started is easy! Once you have cloned the repository, simply instruct your assistant agent:

```
let's start the project @manager.md
```

Your AI agent will interpret this request, initiate the project setup `workflow`, and guide you through the initial steps.

### Available Commands

Once setup is complete, you can use these powerful commands:

```bash
./ai-dev setup                    # Initialize project setup
./ai-dev generate <prd_file>      # Generate tasks from PRD
./ai-dev run <prp_file>           # Execute Project Response Plans
./ai-dev optimize <prompt_file>   # Optimize prompt files and reduce token costs
./ai-dev audit                    # Run comprehensive security audit
./ai-dev sync                     # Synchronize with framework updates
./ai-dev help                     # Show all available commands
```

## üí° Why Choose This Framework?

*   **Increased Productivity:** Automate repetitive tasks and accelerate the development cycle.
*   **Enterprise Security:** Production-ready security with input validation, sandboxed execution, and continuous auditing.
*   **Reduced Errors:** Security safeguards and automated testing minimize regressions.
*   **Cost Savings:** Advanced token optimization reduces LLM operational expenses by up to 40%.
*   **Community-Powered:** Benefit from shared improvements and optimizations from the global developer community.
*   **Full Transparency:** Understand exactly what your agent is doing at every step.
*   **Granular Control:** Maintain human oversight at critical junctures.
*   **Future-Proof:** An extensible system adaptable to new tools and AI models.

## üìö Documentation and Resources

*   **`manager.md`**: The main entry point and map of all available `workflows`.
*   **`.ai_workflow/FRAMEWORK_GUIDE.md`**: Comprehensive guide on the framework's philosophy, `workflows`, and component usage.
*   **`.ai_workflow/AGENT_GUIDE.md`**: Guidelines and best practices for AI agents operating within this repository.
*   **`.ai_workflow/GLOBAL_AI_RULES.md`**: General agent rules and behavioral guidelines.
