# AI-Assisted Development Framework

This repository provides a powerful, AI-assisted software development lifecycle framework. It's designed to guide any large language model (LLM) agent through the entire process of transforming a high-level idea into a high-quality, well-architected, and maintainable codebase.

## Why Use This Framework?

Developing with AI agents can be challenging due to their stateless nature and the need for precise instructions. This framework solves these problems by:

-   **Structuring the Development Process:** Breaking down complex tasks into manageable, guided steps.
-   **Ensuring Best Practices:** Enforcing industry-standard methodologies for PRD creation, task planning, code execution, and quality assurance.
-   **Maintaining Control & Safety:** Implementing strict protocols for code changes, error handling, and secret management.
-   **Promoting Continuous Improvement:** Integrating a feedback loop for identifying and addressing technical debt.
-   **Being Agent-Agnostic:** Designed to work with any capable LLM agent (Gemini, Claude, GPT-4, etc.).

## The Core Workflow: A 4-Step Lifecycle

The framework operates as a continuous loop, guiding your AI agent through distinct phases:

1.  **Strategy & Architecture (The "WHAT" and "WHY")**
2.  **Planning (The "HOW")**
3.  **Execution (The "BUILD")**
4.  **Feedback & Refactoring (The "IMPROVE")**

Each phase is driven by a dedicated Markdown file, acting as a detailed prompt for your AI agent.

## Getting Started: Your One-Step Project Setup

To use this framework for a new project, simply clone this repository and run the `setup.sh` script. It will handle all the initial configuration for you.

### Recommended Tools for Optimal AI Interaction

For the best experience and to maximize the AI agent's effectiveness, we highly recommend using a Multi-Context Processing (MCP) tool. These tools help manage the large context windows required for the AI to understand the entire project, multiple files, and long conversations.

-   **Context7 (Recommended):** A powerful tool designed specifically for managing and providing context to LLMs. It allows you to easily feed multiple files, previous conversations, and specific instructions to your AI agent.
-   **Other Context Management Tools:** Explore other tools that allow you to load and manage large amounts of text/code for your LLM.

### Step 1: Clone the Framework Repository

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
git clone [URL_OF_THIS_REPOSITORY] my-new-project-name
cd my-new-project-name
```

Replace `[URL_OF_THIS_REPOSITORY]` with the actual URL of this GitHub repository (e.g., `https://github.com/AnglDavd/AI-WorkFlow.git`).

### Step 2: Run the Interactive Setup Script

Make the script executable and run it:

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

This interactive script will:

-   Prompt you for your new project's name.
-   Allow you to customize the name of the workflow directory (default: `.ai_workflow`).
-   Create your project folder and move all framework files into it.
-   Initialize a clean Git repository for your new project.
-   Update all configuration files (like `.gitignore` and `README.md`) to reflect your choices.
-   Delete itself after completion.

### Step 3: Navigate to Your New Project

After the script finishes, it will tell you to navigate to your newly created project directory. For example:

```bash
cd ../my-new-project-name
```

Your project is now set up and ready to go!

## Using the Framework: A Step-by-Step Guide

Now that your project is configured, you can start guiding your AI agent through the development process. All workflow files are located in the directory you chose during setup (default: `.ai_workflow/`).

### Phase 1: Strategy & Architecture (The "WHAT" and "WHY")

**Goal:** Define the project's vision, scope, and technical foundation.

**File:** `.ai_workflow/create-prd.md`

**How to Use:**

1.  **Start the Conversation:** Tell your AI agent:
    > "Let's start a new project. Please use the guide in `.ai_workflow/create-prd.md` to help me define the product requirements document (PRD)."
2.  **Interact with the AI:** The AI, acting as a Senior Technical Product Manager and Solution Architect, will ask you a series of structured questions about:
    -   The business problem and goals.
    -   Target users and market context.
    -   **Technology Stack:** It will guide you through selecting the project archetype (Full-Stack, Backend, Frontend) and recommend popular, robust technology stacks (e.g., Next.js, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis).
    -   **UI/UX Design System:** It will offer you a choice between an opinionated default (like ShadCN/UI for developers) or a custom, fine-grained design definition.
    -   Non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability).
    -   Data modeling (primary entities, attributes, relationships).
3.  **Output:** The AI will generate a comprehensive PRD in Markdown format (e.g., `prd-my-feature.md`) in your project's root directory.

**What You Achieve:** A clear, unambiguous blueprint for your project, ensuring all stakeholders are aligned before development begins.

### Phase 2: Planning (The "HOW")

**Goal:** Translate the PRD into a detailed, actionable list of engineering tasks.

**File:** `.ai_workflow/generate-tasks.md`

**How to Use:**

1.  **Point to the PRD:** Tell your AI agent:
    > "Now that we have the PRD, please use `.ai_workflow/generate-tasks.md` to create a detailed task list from `prd-my-feature.md`."
2.  **AI Analysis:** The AI, acting as a Senior Technical Lead, will analyze the PRD, extract all requirements, and propose a high-level task breakdown.
3.  **Confirm & Generate:** Confirm the high-level plan, and the AI will generate a comprehensive task list in Markdown format (e.g., `tasks-my-feature.md`) in your project's root directory.
    -   Tasks will include specific setup steps, feature implementation, testing, documentation, and deployment considerations.
    -   Tasks will have complexity estimates (S/M/L/XL) and explicit dependencies.
    -   Tasks will be traceable back to the PRD's functional requirements (e.g., `Fulfills: FR-1`).

**What You Achieve:** A clear roadmap for development, breaking down the project into manageable, executable steps.

### Phase 3: Execution (The "BUILD")

**Goal:** Implement the tasks defined in the task list, producing the actual code.

**File:** `.ai_workflow/process-task-list.md`

**How to Use:**

1.  **Start Execution:** Tell your AI agent:
    > "Okay, let's start working on the tasks. Please use `.ai_workflow/process-task-list.md` to guide you through `tasks-my-feature.md`."
2.  **AI as Developer:** The AI will act as a Developer, picking the next available task.
3.  **Interactive & Controlled:**
    -   The AI will implement **one sub-task at a time**.
    -   After each sub-task, it will report its progress and **wait for your explicit approval** before proceeding.
    -   It will perform **atomic Git commits** for each completed sub-task.
    -   **Error Handling:** If tests fail or setup encounters issues, the AI will revert changes, report the error, and await your instructions.
    -   **Secret Management:** The AI is strictly instructed to never hardcode secrets and to use environment variables.
    -   **Blocker Protocol:** If the AI encounters ambiguity or a blocker, it will stop, explain the issue, and propose solutions.
    -   **Dynamic Task Management:** It can propose new tasks if discovered during implementation.

**What You Achieve:** A high-quality codebase built incrementally, with full control over each step, ensuring safety and stability.

### Phase 4: Feedback & Refactoring (The "IMPROVE")

**Goal:** Continuously improve the codebase by identifying and addressing technical debt and anti-patterns.

**File:** `.ai_workflow/review-and-refactor.md`

**How to Use:**

1.  **Initiate Review:** Once a significant feature or module is complete, tell your AI agent:
    > "Please use `.ai_workflow/review-and-refactor.md` to analyze the codebase (or a specific module like `src/auth/`) for refactoring opportunities."
2.  **AI as Architect:** The AI, acting as a Senior Software Architect, will analyze the code for:
    -   Complexity and readability issues.
    -   Violations of SOLID principles.
    -   Code duplication.
    -   Performance bottlenecks.
3.  **Report & Propose:** The AI will generate a structured report of its findings and propose concrete refactoring tasks.
4.  **Approve Refactoring:** You can then approve these refactoring tasks, and the AI will add them to your main task list (`tasks-my-feature.md`) for future implementation.

**What You Achieve:** A codebase that actively fights technical debt, remains clean, maintainable, and performs optimally over time.
