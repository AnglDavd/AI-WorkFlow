## Objective
This node logs a specific event or message to the work journal for the current session or task.

## Commands
```bash
# Arguments: $1 = log_type (e.g., INFO, ERROR, START, END), $2 = message
# Can also use WORKFLOW_ARGS if called via workflow calling mechanism

if [ -n "${WORKFLOW_ARGS:-}" ]; then
    # Parse arguments from WORKFLOW_ARGS
    set -- $WORKFLOW_ARGS
    LOG_TYPE="$1"
    MESSAGE="$2"
else
    # Use direct parameters
    LOG_TYPE="$1"
    MESSAGE="$2"
fi
TIMESTAMP=$(date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

# Determine the journal file. For simplicity, we'll use a single file for now.
# In a more advanced setup, this could be per-session or per-task.
JOURNAL_FILE=".ai_workflow/work_journal/session_log.md"

echo "[${TIMESTAMP}] [${LOG_TYPE}] - ${MESSAGE}" >> "$JOURNAL_FILE"
```

## Verification Criteria
The command should exit with 0, and the message should be appended to the `session_log.md` file.

## Next Steps
- This is typically a utility node. The calling workflow will proceed based on its own logic.
