# Contextual Help Workflow

## Purpose
Provide intelligent, context-aware help and documentation that adapts to the user's current project type, framework, experience level, and specific situation to deliver the most relevant guidance and examples.

## When to Use
- User requests help or documentation
- Command fails and user needs guidance
- New user onboarding
- Complex workflow explanation needed
- Troubleshooting assistance

## Prerequisites
- Framework structure available
- Project type detection (optional but recommended)
- Access to help documentation

## Context Detection Engine
