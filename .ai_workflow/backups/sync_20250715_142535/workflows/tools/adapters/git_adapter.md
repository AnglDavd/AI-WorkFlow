## Objective
This node acts as a conceptual adapter for Git tool calls, translating abstract actions into concrete Git shell commands.

## Commands
```bash
# Arguments: $1 = action, $2 = args_string (e.g., "message='Initial commit'")

ACTION="$1"
ARGS_STRING="$2"

CONCRETE_COMMAND=""

case "$ACTION" in
    "add_all")
        CONCRETE_COMMAND="git add ."
        ;;
    "commit")
        # Extract message from ARGS_STRING
        MESSAGE=$(echo "$ARGS_STRING" | sed -n 's/.*message=\'\'\([^\']\+\)\'\'.*/\1/p')
        CONCRETE_COMMAND="git commit -m \"${MESSAGE}\"";;
    "checkout_branch")
        # Extract name from ARGS_STRING
        NAME=$(echo "$ARGS_STRING" | sed -n 's/.*name=\'\'\([^\']\+\)\'\'.*/\1/p')
        CONCRETE_COMMAND="git checkout -b \"${NAME}\"";;
    *)
        echo "Error: Unknown Git action: $ACTION"
        ./.ai_workflow/workflows/common/error.md "Unknown Git action: $ACTION"
        exit 1
        ;;
esac

echo "Simulated Concrete Command: ${CONCRETE_COMMAND}"
# In a real implementation, the agent would now execute: run_shell_command "$CONCRETE_COMMAND"
```

## Verification Criteria
The command should exit with 0, and the simulated concrete Git command should be displayed.

## Next Steps
- This is a conceptual adapter. The process is finished after displaying the command.
