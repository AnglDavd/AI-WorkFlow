## Objective
This node handles generic errors, informs the user, and logs the event, providing basic diagnostic suggestions.

## Commands
```bash
# Get error message from workflow arguments or parameter
if [ -n "${WORKFLOW_ARGS:-}" ]; then
    ERROR_MESSAGE="$WORKFLOW_ARGS"
else
    ERROR_MESSAGE="$1"
fi

echo "❌ An unexpected error occurred: ${ERROR_MESSAGE}"

# Log to project state and work journal
TIMESTAMP=$(date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
echo "[${TIMESTAMP}] - ERROR - ${ERROR_MESSAGE}" >> ./.ai_workflow/_project_state.log
log_workflow_event "ERROR" "Workflow failed: ${ERROR_MESSAGE}"

# Provide basic diagnostic suggestions based on common error patterns
SUGGESTION=""

if [[ "$ERROR_MESSAGE" == *"command not found"* ]]; then
    SUGGESTION="Suggestion: The command might not be installed or not in your PATH. Please check your environment setup."
elif [[ "$ERROR_MESSAGE" == *"No such file or directory"* ]]; then
    SUGGESTION="Suggestion: A required file or directory is missing. Please verify the paths and file existence."
elif [[ "$ERROR_MESSAGE" == *"Permission denied"* ]]; then
    SUGGESTION="Suggestion: You might not have the necessary permissions. Try running the command with 'sudo' if appropriate, or check file/directory permissions."
elif [[ "$ERROR_MESSAGE" == *"syntax error"* ]]; then
    SUGGESTION="Suggestion: There's a syntax error in the command or script. Please review the command for typos or incorrect syntax."
fi

if [ -n "$SUGGESTION" ]; then
    echo "💡 Diagnostic Hint: ${SUGGESTION}"
else
    echo "💡 Diagnostic Hint: Please review the error message and logs for more details. You may need to manually debug this issue."
fi
```

## Next Steps
- This is a terminal node. The process is halted. Further debugging may be required.
