## Status: [Planning / In-Progress / Blocked / Completed]

## Key Documents
- **PRD:** (Link to `prd-feature-name.md` will be populated here)
- **Task List:** (Link to `tasks-prd-feature-name.md` will be populated here)
- **Progress Report:** (Link to `progress_report.md` will be populated here)
- **Feedback Summary:** (Link to `feedback_summary.md` will be populated here)

## Instructions
1.  Start with `create-prd.md` to define the product requirements.
2.  Use `generate-tasks.md` to break down the PRD into a task list.
3.  Use `process-task-list.md` as the execution guide to complete the tasks.
4.  Once a significant set of features is complete, use `review-and-refactor.md` to analyze the codebase and propose improvements. This initiates a continuous improvement cycle.
5.  **To generate the final framework feedback report:** Change the `Status` of this project to `Completed`. The AI agent will then use `feedback_prompt.md` to generate `feedback_summary.md`.
