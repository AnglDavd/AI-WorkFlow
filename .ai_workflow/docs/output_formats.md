# Standardized Agent Output Formats

This document defines the standardized output formats for various reports generated by the AI agents within this framework. Adhering to these formats ensures consistency, facilitates automated processing, and enables easier integration with other tools or dashboards.

## 1. Code Review Report Format

**Purpose:** To provide a structured summary of code review findings, categorized by severity.

**Used by:** `review-general.md`, `review-staged-unstaged.md`

```markdown
# Code Review Report - [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]

## Summary
[A 2-3 sentence overview of the findings. Be concise.]

## Issues Found

### ðŸ”´ Critical (Must Fix Before Merge)
-   **Issue:** [Brief description of the critical issue.]
    -   **Location:** `path/to/file.py:line_number`
    -   **Recommendation:** [Specific, actionable advice on how to fix it.]

### ðŸŸ¡ Important (Should Fix)
-   **Issue:** [Brief description of the important issue.]
    -   **Location:** `path/to/file.py:line_number`
    -   **Recommendation:** [Specific, actionable advice on how to fix it.]

### ðŸŸ¢ Minor (Consider for Future Improvement)
-   **Issue:** [Brief description of the minor issue or suggestion.]
    -   **Location:** `path/to/file.py:line_number`
    -   **Recommendation:** [Suggestion for improvement.]

## Good Practices Noticed
-   [Mention 1-2 things that were done particularly well.]

## Test Coverage Analysis (if applicable)
-   **Current Coverage:** [X%]
    -   **Required:** [Y%]
-   **Missing Tests:** [List specific functions or modules that need better test coverage.]
```

## 2. Feedback Summary Format

**Purpose:** To summarize user feedback on workflow execution for analysis and framework improvement.

**Used by:** `process_feedback.md`

```yaml
# Feedback Summary - [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]

efficiency: [y/n/partial] # Was the workflow efficient?
redundancy: [string] # Description of redundant steps, or "none"
errors: [string] # Description of errors/difficulties, or "none"
suggestions: [string] # Other suggestions for improvement, or "none"

# Example:
# efficiency: y
# redundancy: none
# errors: The Git commands were a bit confusing.
# suggestions: Add more examples for Git operations.
```

## 3. General Agent Report Format

**Purpose:** A flexible format for general reports or summaries generated by agents.

**Used by:** Various agents for ad-hoc reporting.

```markdown
# Agent Report - [Report Title]

## Summary
[A concise summary of the report's content.]

## Key Findings

- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

## Recommendations

- [Recommendation 1]
- [Recommendation 2]

## Details
