## üéØ Core Workflow: From Idea to Code

This section outlines the primary, end-to-end workflow for developing new features or products using the framework.

### üí° Step 1: Ideation & Product Requirements Document (PRD) Creation

Every great feature starts with a clear understanding of the problem and the desired solution. The framework helps you formalize your ideas into a detailed PRD.

-   **Purpose:** To define *what* needs to be built and *why*.
-   **Key Tool:** `manager.sh new-prd`
-   **Underlying Prompt:** `.ai_workflow/create-prd.md`

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Idea/Concept] --> B{Execute manager.sh new-prd}
    B --> C[AI Agent - Senior Technical Product Manager]
    C --> D{Interactive Q&A with User}
    D --> E[Generated PRD in .ai_workflow/PRPs/generated/]
    E --> F[Review & Approval by User]
```

### üìù Step 2: Task Breakdown & Planning

Once the PRD is approved, the next step is to break down the high-level requirements into actionable, granular tasks that an AI agent can execute.

-   **Purpose:** To translate PRD requirements into a detailed, verifiable task list.
-   **Key Tool:** (Implicitly, the AI agent will use the PRD as context for the `generate-tasks.md` prompt)
-   **Underlying Prompt:** `.ai_workflow/generate-tasks.md`

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Approved PRD] --> B[AI Agent - Senior Technical Lead]
    B --> C[Analyzes PRD & Codebase]
    C --> D[Generates Task List in .ai_workflow/PRPs/]
    D --> E[Review & Approval by User]
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Step 3: Code Implementation & Execution

With a clear task list in hand, the AI agent can now proceed with implementing the code, validating each step along the way.

-   **Purpose:** To execute the task list, write code, and perform continuous validation.
-   **Key Tool:** `manager.sh run`
-   **Underlying Prompt:** `.ai_workflow/process-task-list.md`

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Approved Task List] --> B{Execute manager.sh run --prp checklist.md}
    B --> C[AI Agent - Detail-Oriented Software Engineer]
    C --> D{Executes Tasks & Validates Each Step}
    D --> E[Working Codebase + Updated Task List]
    E --> F[Final Review & Approval by User]
```

### üîÑ Step 4: Review & Refactor (Continuous Improvement)

After significant development, it's crucial to review the codebase for technical debt, anti-patterns, and areas for optimization. This step ensures the long-term health of your project.

-   **Purpose:** To maintain code quality, identify refactoring opportunities, and ensure architectural integrity.
-   **Key Tool:** (Implicitly, the AI agent will use the `review-and-refactor.md` prompt)
-   **Underlying Prompt:** `.ai_workflow/review-and-refactor.md`

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Working Codebase] --> B[AI Agent - Senior Software Architect]
    B --> C[Analyzes Codebase]
    C --> D[Generates Refactoring Report & Proposed Tasks]
    D --> E[Review & Approval by User]
    E --> F[New Refactoring Tasks Added to Checklist]
    F --> A
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Specialized Workflows & Commands

Beyond the core development cycle, the framework provides specialized commands for specific needs.

### üöÄ Direct Product Requirement Prompt (PRP) Creation

Sometimes, you might have a well-defined technical task that doesn't require a full PRD. In such cases, you can directly create a PRP.

-   **Purpose:** To generate a detailed, implementation-focused PRP for a specific feature or technical task.
-   **Key Tool:** `manager.sh new-prp`
-   **Underlying Prompts:**
    -   `.ai_workflow/commands/PRPs/prp-base-create.md` (for general features)
    -   `.ai_workflow/commands/PRPs/prp-spec-create.md` (for specification-driven transformations)
    -   `.ai_workflow/commands/PRPs/prp-task-create.md` (for focused task lists)

### üèÉ Rapid Development & Experimental Workflows

For hackathons or highly experimental features, the framework includes advanced, parallelized workflows. These are resource-intensive and require careful oversight.

-   **Purpose:** To accelerate development through parallel AI agent execution for complex research or implementation tasks.
-   **Underlying Prompts:** Located in `.ai_workflow/commands/rapid-development/experimental/`
    -   `create-base-prp-parallel.md`
    -   `create-planning-parallel.md`
    -   `hackathon-prp-parallel.md`
    -   `hackathon-research.md`
    -   `parallel-prp-creation.md`
    -   `user-story-rapid.md`

    **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** These prompts are highly experimental and can consume significant computational resources. Use with caution and monitor agent activity closely.

### üîç Code Quality & Review

Maintain high code standards with dedicated review and refactoring commands.

-   **Purpose:** To analyze code for quality, identify refactoring opportunities, and ensure adherence to best practices.
-   **Underlying Prompts:** Located in `.ai_workflow/commands/code-quality/`
    -   `refactor-simple.md`
    -   `review-general.md`
    -   `review-staged-unstaged.md`

### üå≥ Git Operations

Streamline your Git workflow with AI-assisted commands for common tasks.

-   **Purpose:** To simplify complex Git operations like conflict resolution and smart commits.
-   **Underlying Prompts:** Located in `.ai_workflow/commands/git-operations/`
    -   `conflict-resolver-general.md`
    -   `conflict-resolver-specific.md`
    -   `smart-resolver.md`

### üöÄ Development Utilities

General utilities to assist with various development tasks.

-   **Purpose:** To provide AI assistance for common development activities like debugging, onboarding, and project priming.
-   **Underlying Prompts:** Located in `.ai_workflow/commands/development/`
    -   `create-pr.md`
    -   `debug-RCA.md`
    -   `new-dev-branch.md`
    -   `onboarding.md`
    -   `prime-core.md`
    -   `smart-commit.md`

## üîÑ Framework Feedback Loop (Continuous Improvement)

To ensure the continuous improvement of the framework itself, a feedback mechanism has been integrated. After significant tasks are completed, the AI agent will suggest providing feedback on the framework's performance.

-   **Purpose:** To gather insights on the framework's usability, performance, and identify areas for enhancement.
-   **Privacy Note:** Any feedback submitted through this mechanism will **ONLY** pertain to the framework's functionality and suggestions for its improvement. **NO project-specific code, sensitive data, or private information will ever be included in these reports or GitHub issues.**
-   **Process:** The `process-task-list.md` prompt will prompt the user for feedback, and the `FRAMEWORK_ASSISTANT` will help generate a pre-filled `gh issue create` command for the main repository.

## ü§ñ The Role of `ai-dev`

The `ai-dev` script is your primary interface with the AI-Assisted Development Framework. It acts as an orchestrator, simplifying the execution of complex AI agent prompts and workflows. Instead of directly interacting with individual `.md` prompt files, you use `ai-dev` to trigger the desired actions.
