# Repository Cleanliness Check

## Purpose
Validate repository cleanliness and remove unnecessary files that should not be tracked in version control.

## Philosophy
Maintain clean, professional repositories by preventing temporary files, backups, and internal development artifacts from being committed.

## Execution Context
- **Frequency**: Pre-commit validation, periodic maintenance
- **Scope**: All tracked files in git repository
- **Approach**: Automated detection and removal with configurable validation
