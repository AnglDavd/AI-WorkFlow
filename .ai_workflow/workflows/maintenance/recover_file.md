# File Recovery Workflow

## Purpose
Recover specific archived files from the obsolete files management system.

## Execution Context
- **Command**: `./ai-dev cleanup --recover <file>`
- **Environment Variable**: `RECOVER_FILE_PATH` - File to recover
- **Approach**: Safe file recovery with validation
- **Safety**: Reversible operation with user confirmation

## Safety Features
- **Search validation**: Confirms file exists before recovery
- **User confirmation**: Multiple confirmation steps
- **Collision handling**: Backup existing files before overwrite
- **Audit trail**: Complete recovery history maintained
- **Directory creation**: Automatically creates target directories

## Integration Points
- Called by `./ai-dev cleanup --recover <file>`
- Integrates with obsolete files management system
- Updates cleanup log with recovery actions
- Provides user-friendly file selection interface
