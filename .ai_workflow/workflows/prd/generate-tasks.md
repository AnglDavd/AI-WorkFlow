# Generate Tasks from PRD

## Purpose
Transforms Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) into structured task lists that can be executed by AI agents using the framework's PRP (Project Response Plan) methodology.

## When to Use
- Converting high-level PRDs into actionable development tasks
- Creating structured implementation plans from business requirements
- Preparing task breakdown for PRP execution workflows

## Objective
Parse a PRD file and generate a comprehensive task list with proper prioritization, dependencies, and implementation guidelines following the framework's PRP template structure.

## Pre-conditions
- Valid PRD file exists in markdown format
- PRD contains clear requirements and acceptance criteria
- Framework is properly initialized (`./ai-dev setup` completed)

## Commands
```bash
# Validate PRD file exists and is readable
if [ -z "$PRD_FILE" ]; then
    echo "ERROR: PRD_FILE parameter required"
    ./.ai_workflow/workflows/common/error.md "PRD file path not provided"
    exit 1
fi

if [ ! -f "$PRD_FILE" ]; then
    echo "ERROR: PRD file not found at: $PRD_FILE"
    ./.ai_workflow/workflows/common/error.md "PRD file does not exist: $PRD_FILE"
    exit 1
fi

# Log workflow start
./.ai_workflow/workflows/common/log_work_journal.md "INFO" "Starting task generation from PRD: $PRD_FILE"

# Generate task breakdown using PRP methodology
echo "üîç Analyzing PRD file: $PRD_FILE"
echo "üìã Generating structured task list..."

# Create output directory if it doesn't exist
OUTPUT_DIR=".ai_workflow/PRPs/generated"
mkdir -p "$OUTPUT_DIR"

# Extract project name from PRD filename
PROJECT_NAME=$(basename "$PRD_FILE" .md)
TASKS_FILE="$OUTPUT_DIR/${PROJECT_NAME}_tasks.md"

# Generate task list header
cat > "$TASKS_FILE" << 'EOF'
# Generated Task List

## Project Overview
**Source PRD:** PLACEHOLDER_PRD_FILE
**Generated:** PLACEHOLDER_DATE
**Framework Version:** v1.0.0

## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
- [ ] **T001**: Environment setup and dependency installation
  - **Priority**: High
  - **Dependencies**: None
  - **Estimated Effort**: 30 minutes
  - **Validation**: Dependencies installed successfully

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
- [ ] **T002**: Core feature implementation
  - **Priority**: High
  - **Dependencies**: T001
  - **Estimated Effort**: 2-4 hours
  - **Validation**: Feature tests pass

### Phase 3: Integration & Testing
- [ ] **T003**: Integration testing and validation
  - **Priority**: Medium
  - **Dependencies**: T002
  - **Estimated Effort**: 1-2 hours
  - **Validation**: All tests pass

### Phase 4: Documentation & Deployment
- [ ] **T004**: Documentation and deployment preparation
  - **Priority**: Medium
  - **Dependencies**: T003
  - **Estimated Effort**: 1 hour
  - **Validation**: Documentation complete

## Implementation Notes
- Follow framework's PRP template structure
- Ensure each task has clear acceptance criteria
- Include validation commands for each phase
- Maintain atomic commits for each completed task

## Next Steps
1. Review generated task list for completeness
2. Create individual PRPs for complex tasks
3. Execute tasks using `./ai-dev run` commands
4. Update task status as work progresses

## Verification Criteria
- Task list file is created successfully
- Contains structured phases with clear dependencies
- Each task has priority, effort estimate, and validation criteria
- PRD content is properly analyzed and integrated
- Output file is valid markdown format

## Input Parameters
- `PRD_FILE`: Path to the Product Requirements Document (required)
- `OUTPUT_DIR`: Custom output directory (optional, defaults to .ai_workflow/PRPs/generated)

## Output
- Structured task list file in markdown format
- Task breakdown with phases, priorities, and dependencies
- Integration with framework's PRP methodology
- Ready for execution via `./ai-dev run` commands

## Next Steps
- **On Success:** Proceed to [Process Task List](../run/process-task-list.md) or individual PRP creation
- **On Failure:** Proceed to [Generic Error Handler](../common/error.md)
