## Objective
This node performs the final cleanup actions based on the setup mode used.

## Pre-conditions
- The setup process is complete.
- The `SETUP_MODE` is defined in `temp_state.vars`.

## Commands
```bash
source ./.ai_workflow/temp_state.vars

```

## Verification Criteria
- The `temp_state.vars` file should be removed from the final project directory.
- The `ARCHITECTURE.md` file should be created in the project root directory.
- The architecture documentation should be customized for the detected project technologies.

## Next Steps
- **On Success:** Proceed to [Workflow Completed](../../common/success.md).
- **On Failure:** Proceed to [Generic Error Handler](../../common/error.md).
