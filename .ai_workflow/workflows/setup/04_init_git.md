## Objective
This node initializes a new Git repository in the newly created project directory.

## Pre-conditions
- The new project directory has been created and populated.
- The current working directory is the parent of the new project directory.

## Commands
```bash
source ./.ai_workflow/temp_state.vars

cd "$PROJECT_NAME"

rm -rf .git
git init > /dev/null 2>&1
git add . > /dev/null 2>&1
git commit -m "Initial commit: Set up AI development framework" > /dev/null 2>&1
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    ./.ai_workflow/workflows/common/error.md "Git initialization failed. Check if Git is installed or if the directory is empty."
    exit 1
fi
```

## Verification Criteria
The command should exit with 0 and a new `.git` directory should exist in the project folder.

## Next Steps
- **On Success:** Proceed to [Final Cleanup](./05_cleanup.md).
- **On Failure:** Proceed to [Generic Error Handler](../../common/error.md).
