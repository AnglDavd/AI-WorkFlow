## üéØ Best Practices for Claude

### Before Starting Any Project
1. **Always check** for existing sessions first
2. **Use smart questioning** - let the framework detect project type
3. **Trust auto-completion** - it's based on current market research
4. **Don't skip quality loop** - it ensures professional standards

### During PRD Creation
1. **Answer contextual questions** thoroughly but concisely
2. **Review tech stack suggestions** before accepting
3. **Validate estimates** against project scope
4. **Use Context7 research** for current trends

### During Task Generation
1. **Let Context7 validate** tech stack patterns
2. **Check complexity classification** is accurate
3. **Ensure cross-validation** with PRD passes
4. **Verify task granularity** (8-40 hours per task)

### During Execution
1. **Trust the iterative process** - let it run its course
2. **Don't bypass quality checks** - they prevent technical debt
3. **Document any manual interventions** needed
4. **Ensure quality certification** before declaring complete

### Before Any Code Changes
1. **Always explain first** - Provide short, concise explanation of what the change does
2. **State the purpose** - Why this change is needed or beneficial
3. **Describe the impact** - What will be different after the change
4. **Then implement** - Only proceed with code after explanation is given

## üö® Error Handling & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Session ID collisions:** Framework auto-resolves
- **Context7 research failures:** Graceful fallback to cached patterns
- **Quality loop timeout:** Manual improvement plan generated
- **MCP Playwright issues:** Verify installation and permissions

### Emergency Commands
```bash
# Reset session if corrupted
./ai-dev reset {session-id}

# Force manual quality review
./ai-dev heal {session-id} --manual

# Export session for debugging
./ai-dev export {session-id}
```
